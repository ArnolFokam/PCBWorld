"""Router provenance guard: never run a router built from other C++ than this tree's.

The build stamps ``ENGINE_CPP_HASH`` (the content hash of ``engine/kicad-patches/``, from
``engine/tools/cpp_content_hash.sh``) next to ``kicad_rl_router.so``. Right before a router
is loaded — the IPC server spawn (default) or the in-process import — the same script hashes
this tree's sources and the two must agree. A mismatch means "the C++ was edited (or this tree
is on other C++ than the build) and nobody rebuilt": every result would be attributed to
sources that did not produce it, so it is an error, not a warning.

    PCBWORLD_ENGINE_ALLOW_MISMATCH=1   downgrade to a warning (deliberately running an old router)

A router built before the stamp existed carries none: it is allowed with one warning per
process (rebuild once and the guard becomes strict). The check is content-based, so a tree that
points at a build made elsewhere (a worktree using the main clone's build or a snapshot) is
judged correctly; mtimes could not do that.

Finding the build (``resolve_build_dir``): a tree with no ``build_rl`` of its own — a git
worktree — looks for a build of ITS C++ among the known places (``build_rl`` and ``var/builds/*``
of this tree and of the main clone) and takes the first whose stamp equals the source hash. Only
an exact match is taken; a stampless build is used only when no stamped one matches (legacy,
warned); none at all leaves the default path so the failure is the ordinary "no router" one,
while "builds exist but every one is of other C++" is raised with that reason by the loader
(``pcb_world.engine.ensure_router_provenance``). An explicit ``PCBWORLD_KICAD_RL_BUILD_DIR`` or
``PCBWORLD_KICAD_RL_MODULE_DIR`` is never second-guessed: it is used, and guarded.

The guard is between the router and THE TREE A PROCESS RUNS FROM, never the tree that built
the router: a run pinned to a snapshot via ``PCBWORLD_KICAD_RL_BUILD_DIR`` is still checked
against ``engine/kicad-patches/`` of the checkout it imports from. Editing that C++ under a
running snapshot therefore makes every NEW worker process refuse — by design: a new worker
also imports the edited Python, so nothing about it is the pinned run any more. Long runs run
from a worktree pinned to a commit.

Hashing is loud: a bundle without the script disables the guard with one warning per process
(an older engine bundle), a script that FAILS is a ``RouterProvenanceError`` carrying its
stderr, never a silent pass. The hash is computed once per process per engine root: the tree a
running process would see is the one it started from, and a refused guard re-raises on retry
without re-hashing.
